Baseline toxic speech detection using TF-IDF n-grams with Naive Bayes (generative) and Random Forest (discriminative). Includes preprocessing, feature extraction, training, validation, and prediction. Highlights class imbalance challenges and suggests improvements like class balancing and transformer-based models.
